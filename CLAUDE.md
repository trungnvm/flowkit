# Google Flow Agent — Agentic Reference

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8100`

## Pre-flight Check

Before ANY workflow, verify:
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/health
# Must return: {"extension_connected": true}
# If false: Chrome extension is not connected — nothing will work
```

---

## Rules (MUST follow)

1. **Media ID is always UUID** — format `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. Never use `CAMS...` / base64 strings (that's mediaGenerationId, a different thing).
2. **Scene prompts = ACTION only** — never describe character appearance. Reference images handle visual consistency via `imageInputs`. Write: `"Pippip juggling fish at the market"`. NOT: `"Pippip the orange tabby cat wearing a blue apron juggling fish"`.
3. **All reference images must exist before scene images** — the worker blocks if any referenced entity is missing `media_id`. Generate ALL ref images first, verify all have `media_id`, then generate scene images.
4. **10s cooldown between API calls** — the worker auto-waits. Don't spam requests.
5. **Locations use landscape, characters use portrait** — reference image orientation depends on entity type.
6. **UUID extraction** — if a response gives `CAMS...` instead of UUID, extract UUID from the `fifeUrl` in the response (URL contains it: `/image/{UUID}?...`).
7. **Cascade on regen** — regenerating an image auto-clears downstream video + upscale. Regenerating video auto-clears upscale.
8. **REGENERATE vs GENERATE** — `GENERATE_IMAGE` skips if image already exists (COMPLETED). Use `REGENERATE_IMAGE` to force a fresh generation (bypasses skip, cascades downstream). Same pattern: `REGENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE` clears existing ref image and generates from scratch.
9. **Edit image includes character refs** — `EDIT_IMAGE` automatically resolves character references from the scene's `character_names` and sends them as imageInputs after the base image: `[base_image, char_A, char_B, ...]`. This helps Google Flow detect and maintain character consistency during edits. Same for `EDIT_CHARACTER_IMAGE`.
10. **Video prompts use sub-clip timing** — structure 8s video as time segments. The scene image is frame 0. Each segment: `[camera] + [action] + [dialogue]`.
11. **Use cinematic camera language** — each sub-clip specifies camera angle + movement + lighting. See `skills/camera-guide.md` for full reference. Follow the emotional arc: wide (opening) → medium+push in (rising) → close-up (peak) → pull back wide (release).
12. **Character dialogue in sub-clips** — embed speech in quotes: `"0-3s: Medium tracking shot, Luna walks to bed. Luna says 'Bye mom, I love you, see you tomorrow.'"` Rules: max 10-15 words per character per 2-3s, multi-character exchanges OK (label each speaker: `Luna asks "Ready?" Hero replies "Let's go."`), use delivery verbs (says, whispers, shouts, asks, replies), silent segments are powerful.
13. **Voice descriptions on characters** — `voice_description` field (max ~30 words) auto-appended to video prompts. Dialogue tone must match voice profile.
14. **No background music** — the worker auto-appends "No background music. Keep only natural sound effects." to all video prompts.

**Complete video_prompt example:**
```
0-3s: Medium tracking shot following Luna to her bed, warm lamplight. Luna says "Bye mom, I love you, see you tomorrow."
3-5s: Close-up of Luna's hand reaching for the bedside lamp. Luna whispers "Goodnight, stars."
5-8s: Static wide shot through bedroom window, starry night sky, moonlight shadows. Silence, gentle wind.
```

## Workflow Recipes

### W1: Create a New Project

Creates project on Google Flow API, detects user tier, creates reference entities.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Project Title",
    "description": "Short description",
    "story": "Full story context used to build character profiles...",
    "language": "en",
    "characters": [
      {"name": "Hero", "entity_type": "character", "description": "Visual appearance only...", "voice_description": "Deep calm heroic voice, speaks slowly with confidence"},
      {"name": "Castle", "entity_type": "location", "description": "Visual description..."},
      {"name": "Magic Sword", "entity_type": "visual_asset", "description": "Visual description..."}
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:** `{id: "<project_id>", name: "...", user_paygate_tier: "PAYGATE_TIER_ONE|TWO", ...}`

**Entity types:** `character`, `location`, `creature`, `visual_asset`, `generic_troop`, `faction`

**What happens:** Project registered on Google Flow, tier auto-detected, each entity gets `image_prompt` auto-generated with composition guidelines matching its type.

### W2: Create Video + Scenes

```bash
# Create video
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/videos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "<PID>", "title": "Episode 1", "description": "...", "display_order": 0}'

# Create scenes (chain them)
# Scene 1: ROOT
# - prompt: for IMAGE generation (what the still frame looks like)
# - video_prompt: for VIDEO generation (sub-clip timing within 8s)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "<VID>",
    "display_order": 0,
    "prompt": "Hero walks into Castle courtyard at dawn. Magic Sword glowing on the wall. Cinematic wide shot.",
    "video_prompt": "0-3s: Hero pushes open the Castle gate and steps into the courtyard. 3-6s: Hero looks up and sees Magic Sword glowing on the wall. 6-8s: Slow zoom on Magic Sword, golden light pulses.",
    "character_names": ["Hero", "Castle", "Magic Sword"],
    "chain_type": "ROOT"
  }'

# Scene 2+: CONTINUATION (chain to previous)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "video_id": "<VID>",
    "display_order": 1,
    "prompt": "Hero reaches for Magic Sword on the Castle wall. Dramatic close-up, glowing light.",
    "video_prompt": "0-2s: Hero walks toward Magic Sword on the Castle wall. 2-5s: Close-up of Hero hand reaching out, fingers wrapping around the hilt. 5-8s: Hero pulls Magic Sword free, burst of golden light fills the room.",
    "character_names": ["Hero", "Castle", "Magic Sword"],
    "chain_type": "CONTINUATION",
    "parent_scene_id": "<previous_scene_id>"
  }'
```

**Scene has TWO prompts:**
- `prompt`: describes the **still image** (frame 0) — `[Character] [action] [at Location]. [Camera/mood].`
- `video_prompt`: describes the **8s video motion** with sub-clip timing — `0-3s: [action]. 3-6s: [action]. 6-8s: [action].`

The worker auto-appends voice context + "no background music" to video_prompt before sending to the API.

**`character_names`:** List ALL reference entities that should appear — characters, locations, assets. Their `media_id`s get passed as `imageInputs` for visual consistency.

### W3: Generate Reference Images

Create a request for EACH entity. Do this BEFORE scene images.

```bash
# Get entity list
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects/<PID>/characters

# For each entity:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "GENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE",
    "character_id": "<entity_id>",
    "project_id": "<PID>"
  }'
```

**Poll until done:**
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests/<RID>
# Wait for status: "COMPLETED"
```

**Verify ALL entities have media_id:**
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects/<PID>/characters
# Every entity must have media_id (UUID format) before proceeding
```

**What happens:** Worker generates image with entity-type composition (portrait for characters, landscape for locations), then uploads it via `uploadImage` to get UUID `media_id`.

### W4: Generate Scene Images

Only after ALL reference images are ready.

```bash
# For each scene:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "GENERATE_IMAGE",
    "scene_id": "<SID>",
    "project_id": "<PID>",
    "video_id": "<VID>",
    "orientation": "VERTICAL"
  }'
```

**Orientation:** `VERTICAL` (portrait 9:16) or `HORIZONTAL` (landscape 16:9)

**What happens:** Worker collects all `media_id`s from entities listed in scene's `character_names`, passes them as `imageInputs`, generates image. If any entity is missing `media_id`, request fails and retries later.

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes?video_id=<VID>"
# Check: vertical_image_status = "COMPLETED", vertical_image_media_id = UUID
```

### W5: Generate Videos

Only after scene images are ready.

```bash
# For each scene with a completed image:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "GENERATE_VIDEO",
    "scene_id": "<SID>",
    "project_id": "<PID>",
    "video_id": "<VID>",
    "orientation": "VERTICAL"
  }'
```

**What happens:** Worker reads scene's `vertical_image_media_id` as `startImage`, submits video gen, polls until complete (can take 2-5 minutes). For CONTINUATION scenes with `parent_scene_id`, also uses `endImage` for smooth transitions.

**Verify:**
```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes?video_id=<VID>"
# Check: vertical_video_status = "COMPLETED", vertical_video_url = GCS URL
```

### W6: Upscale Videos (TIER_TWO only)

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "UPSCALE_VIDEO",
    "scene_id": "<SID>",
    "project_id": "<PID>",
    "video_id": "<VID>",
    "orientation": "VERTICAL"
  }'
```

**Note:** Upscale to 4K requires `PAYGATE_TIER_TWO`. TIER_ONE will get "caller does not have permission".

### W7: Download + Concat Videos

```bash
# Get scene video URLs
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes?video_id=<VID>"
# Extract vertical_video_url (or vertical_upscale_url if upscaled) for each scene

# Download each scene video, then concat with ffmpeg:
# 1. Normalize (same codec/resolution/fps)
ffmpeg -y -i scene_1.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 \
  -vf "scale=720:1280:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=720:1280:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2" \
  -r 24 -pix_fmt yuv420p -an scene_1_norm.mp4

# 2. Create concat list
echo "file 'scene_1_norm.mp4'" > concat.txt
echo "file 'scene_2_norm.mp4'" >> concat.txt
# ...

# 3. Concat
ffmpeg -y -f concat -safe 0 -i concat.txt -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```

---

## Full Pipeline Order

```
1. Health check          GET  /health → extension_connected: true
2. Create project        POST /api/projects (with entities)
3. Create video          POST /api/videos
4. Create scenes         POST /api/scenes (with character_names, chain_type)
5. Gen ref images        POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_CHARACTER_IMAGE} per entity
   ↳ Wait ALL complete, verify all have media_id (UUID)
6. Gen scene images      POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_IMAGE} per scene
   ↳ Wait ALL complete, verify vertical_image_media_id (UUID)
7. Gen videos            POST /api/requests {type: GENERATE_VIDEO} per scene
   ↳ Wait ALL complete (2-5 min each)
8. (Optional) Upscale    POST /api/requests {type: UPSCALE_VIDEO} per scene
9. Download + concat     ffmpeg normalize + concat
```

**Between steps 5→6:** MUST verify every entity has `media_id`. If any is missing, scene image gen will block.

**Between steps 6→7:** Verify `vertical_image_media_id` is UUID format for each scene.

## Common Patterns

### Check if all ref images are ready
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/projects/<PID>/characters | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json; entities=json.load(sys.stdin); \
  missing=[e['name'] for e in entities if not e.get('media_id')]; \
  print('READY' if not missing else f'MISSING: {missing}')"
```

### Fix CAMS... media_id on a scene (extract UUID from URL)
```bash
# Get scene, extract UUID from vertical_image_url
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes/<SID> | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json,re; s=json.load(sys.stdin); \
  url=s.get('vertical_image_url',''); \
  m=re.search(r'/([0-9a-f-]{36})',url); \
  print(m.group(1) if m else 'NO UUID')"

# Patch with correct UUID
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes/<SID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vertical_image_media_id": "<UUID>"}'
```

### Reset a scene for regeneration
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8100/api/scenes/<SID> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vertical_image_status": "PENDING",
    "vertical_image_media_id": null,
    "vertical_image_url": null,
    "vertical_video_status": "PENDING",
    "vertical_video_media_id": null,
    "vertical_video_url": null,
    "vertical_upscale_status": "PENDING",
    "vertical_upscale_media_id": null,
    "vertical_upscale_url": null
  }'
```
